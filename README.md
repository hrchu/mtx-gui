# mtx-gui

##  Update 2015-10-04

This Version of mtx-gui will no longer be maintained by me but I'll leave only if someone really wants to
try it ...

### Description

This tool is my first try to create a simple gui for the commandline tool mtx.
It has some evil hacks but it should work for simple task. It's basically a 
sparetime project but if you have ideas or even better code then mine feel free 
to tell me :) Im always willing to improve my skills. 

Short example to use the gui:

 - download the sourcecode
 - run it in a console:  $ sudo python /path_to_the_repository/mtx-gui/app.py

If you have a Mediachanger the gui should show it as a button with the device name on it,
simply click the button and you'll get two new columns with the Data Slots and the Storage Slots.
To load or unload media to the Media changer simply right click on a Data or Storage Slot, green Storage Slots should get a menu with a load option
and if a Data Slot has a medium loaded you'll get a menu for unload it to one of the Storage slots.
A simple Statusbar will print out the last result that mtx returned.

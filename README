First try to create a small gui for the mtx tool, so dont expect to much it's under construction still.

Short example to use the gui:

 - download the sourcecode
 - run it in a console:  $ sudo python /path_to_the_repository/mtx-gui/app.py

If you have a Mediachanger the gui should show it as a button with the device name on it,
simply click the button and you'll get two new columns with the Data Slots and the Storage Slots.
To load or unload media to the Media changer simply right click on a Data or Storage Slot, green Storage Slots should get a menu with a load option
and if a Data Slot has a medium loaded you'll get a menu for unload it to one of the Storage slots.

some things to come:
 - Statusbar for the return values of the mtx tool (for now you just see it on the console)
 - Documentation ( I know its not usefull for now)
